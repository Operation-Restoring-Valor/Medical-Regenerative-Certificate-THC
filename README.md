Operation Restoring Valor: The Medical Regenerative Certificate (THC Protocol)
==============================================================================

**A Federal Protocol for Physical Regeneration and Soldier Readiness**

**By Dr. Correo Hofstad - USAF** *Founder, Operation Restoring Valor*

For too long, cannabis has been categorized solely as a recreational drug or a "mental crutch" for PTSD. This view ignores the physiological potential of cannabinoids in high-performance recovery. Under **Operation Restoring Valor**, we are implementing a new standard: **The Medical Regenerative Certificate.**

This is **NOT** for getting high. This is **NOT** for mental health. This is for **Regenerative Medicine**: the physical repair of wounds, nerves, and tissue to keep our soldiers combat-ready.

**The FDA & DoD Framework: Regenerative Use**
---------------------------------------------

The Department of Defense, in alignment with FDA allowances for regenerative research, acknowledges that specific biological compounds can accelerate healing. We are authorizing the issuance of the **Medical Regenerative Certificate** to eligible Veterans.

This certificate acts as a Federal License, permitting the use of specific THC and CBD substances **exclusively on Federal Property**. By keeping usage within the wire, we ensure that the soldier remains within the jurisdiction of Federal Law and under the protective observation of the command structure.

**The Science: Sativa vs. Indica (The Electron Theory)**
--------------------------------------------------------

Not all cannabis is created equal. Our protocol relies on the bio-electrical properties of the plant, specifically regarding pH levels and electron transfer.

### **1\. Sativa: The Energy Donor (Approved)**

We **ONLY** provide licensing for soldiers to freely smoke **Sativa** strains.

-   **High pH:** Sativa strains possess a higher pH balance.

-   **Electron Donation:** High pH substances provide the body with energy in the form of excess **electrons**.

-   **Combat Application:** This electron surplus fuels cellular regeneration and maintains alertness. It supports motor control and active recovery without sedation.

### **2\. Indica: The Energy Thief (Prohibited)**

**Indica** strains are strictly **prohibited** under this certificate.

-   **Low pH:** Indica strains are acidic (low pH).

-   **Electron Absorption:** Low pH substances absorb energy (electrons) from the body.

-   **The "Downer" Effect:** This creates a "heroin-like" sedation that inhibits motor control and depresses the central nervous system. A soldier on Indica is a liability; a soldier on Sativa is recovering energy.

**Security Clearance & Trust**
------------------------------

Access to the Medical Regenerative Certificate is not a right; it is a privilege reserved for the trustworthy.

-   **Security Clearance Review:** Every evaluation for this certificate includes a full **Security Clearance Review**.

-   **The Trust Standard:** If we do not trust a soldier with our secrets, we certainly do not trust them with THC.

-   **Revocation:** Any violation of the "Sativa Only" rule or usage off Federal Property without authorization results in immediate revocation.

**Conclusion: Physical Health, No Crutches**
--------------------------------------------

This program is designed for physical health---wound healing, nerve repair, and biological optimization. We do not authorize this for "stress relief" or "PTSD management," which we view as relying on a mental crutch.

We are building super-soldiers, not stoners. Through the **Medical Regenerative Certificate**, we utilize the electron-donating power of Sativa to restore the physical valor of our troops, right here on Federal soil.
